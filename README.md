# bucky-forecasts

Weekly output from https://github.com/mattkinsey/bucky

County level output will only be included for the most recent week (and old weeks will have it removed from the git history). This is due to the overall size limits GH places on repos.

Forecasts prior to 2020-10-12 may be included later. They have a different format so they will need to translated into the current schema.
